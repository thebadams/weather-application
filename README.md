# The Weather Application

## Description

This is a simple weather search application that takes a city name as input, and displays the current weather and a five day forecast for that city.

## Expected Behavior

1. When the User first loads the application, they will be greeted with a search form, asking them to fill it out and search.
1. When a city is filled out and the button clicked, the application will render the current weather, then below it 5 cards indicating a five day forecast.
1. The cities that have been searched for will be displayed in a list below the search form (these are stored in localStorage).
1. The application displays a responsive layout, changing the layout the various cards that hold the information as the screen decreases in width.
